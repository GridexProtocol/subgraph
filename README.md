# Gridex Protocol Subgraph

The Gridex Protocol Subgraph consists of a set of GraphQL endpoints that can be used to query data related
to the Gridex Protocol. Currently, there are two subgraphs:

1. [Core](https://github.com/GridexProtocol/subgraph/subgraphs/core): Tracks all data related to the Gridex Protocol core contracts.
2. [Holder](https://github.com/GridexProtocol/subgraph/subgraphs/holder): Tracks all holders of [GDX](https://arbiscan.io/token/0x2F27118E3D2332aFb7d165140Cf1bB127eA6975d) tokens.
